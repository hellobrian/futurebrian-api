# futurebrian-api

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### PlanetScale

Login, create new branch and shadow branch for prisma migrations

```sh
pscale auth login
pscale branch create <new-branch>
pscale branch create shadow
```

Connect to DB branch

```sh
pscale connect <new-branch> --port 3309
```

In a new terminal window, connect to shadow branch

```sh
pscale connect shadow --port 3310
```

### Prisma

After making schema changes run migrate and generate commands. Then try CRUD actions in studio.

```sh
npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration-name>
npx prisma generate
npx prisma studio
```

### Next.js

Interact and develop API endpoints with Next.js

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
